We require a front end and backend solution that can manage our inventory and sales data. The system should have the ability to add, view, update, and delete product data.
Additionally, the system should have the capacity to link the product data to customer orders and shopping carts. This linkage should allow us to track which products are being sold and at what quantities.

Data accuracy and security are important to us. We want the system to have appropriate validation checks and error handling to ensure that the data is correct and secure.
